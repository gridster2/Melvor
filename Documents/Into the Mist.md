# Into the Mist: A Practical Guide

This is a guide to [Into the Mist](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Into_the_Mist), the most challenging dungeon in the game. It needs only to be completed once, but it cannot be idled.

This guide will attempt to give clear instructions that, if properly followed, guarantee success. There are other strategies for this dungeon, many of which rely on a small degree of luck; the advice in this guide is based on the numbers, and reliability.

This guide assumes that the player has a base of 1000 hitpoints (99 Hitpoints skill, plus the pet), the defence pet, access to tier IV potions, and equipment from the high-level dungeons. Without these, the dungeon is nearly impossible to complete.

### The Brute-Force

If you don't want to wait to be properly ready for this dungeon, it _is_ possible to just spam-eat through it (in theory, at least). This requires the player to be able to switch equipment after each monster, to eat faster than any special attack can hit (at least once every 0.1 seconds), to attack faster than the enemy (more than once every 2.2 seconds), and to have a _massive_ supply of food.

**Because of the enemy's attack speed and healing abilities, relying on manual eating will probably not work.**

The following table gives the damage reduction needed for each equipment set (only for the three boss stages, not the Afflicted warmup).

| Hitpoints | Melee Reduction | Ranged Reduction | Magic Reduction |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 950       | 42              | 0                | 82              |
| 960       | 40              | 0                | 80              |
| 970       | 39              | 0                | 79              |
| 980       | 37              | 0                | 78              |
| 990       | 35              | 0                | 77              |
| 1000      | 34              | 0                | 75              |
| 1010      | 32              | 0                | 74              |
| 1020      | 30              | 0                | 73              |
| 1030      | 29              | 0                | 72              |

### Affliction

While in [Into the Mist](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Into_the_Mist), every successful attack on the player decreases maximum hitpoints by 1%, up to a maximum of 50%. This includes the warmup monsters as well as the bosses. Affliction resets after every monster, but sets in again quickly; the player must therefore be prepared to fight through most of the dungeon at half health.

Most importantly, Affliction affects auto-eat, making it much more dangerous (if not impossible) to idle even the warmup monsters.

All afflicted enemies in the dungeon have a base 20% damage reduction, and the bosses have a base 40%. This drags out combat, making the effects of Affliction last longer, and build up more.

The [Guardian Amulet](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Guardian_Amulet) triggers only at 50% of the current max hitpoints; that is, a player with 990 hitpoints and 50 affliction will only get the bonus 5% damage reduction when under 247 hitpoints.

### The Afflicted (Warmup)

The first 20 monsters in the dungeon are a random selection of monsters whose combat levels are in the range 165 and 677 (see [Damage Reduction Tables for Dungeons](https://github.com/gridster2/Melvor/blob/main/Documents/Damage%20Reduction%20Tables%20for%20Dungeons.md)) for a full list. These monsters deal Affliction. They deal normal damage, and so long as the player is switching to the appropriate equipment set, it shouldn't pose much of a threat.

### [Mysterious Figure - Phase 1](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Mysterious_Figure_-_Phase_1)

For this phase of the boss fight, use the following melee loadout. The choice of weapon is up to the player, but speed is important; the [Sunset Rapier](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Sunset_Rapier) or [Infernal Claw](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Infernal_Claw) are good options. The [Guardian Amulet](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Guardian_Amulet) is not used, as it slows attack speed without hitting any important breakpoints. The [Fury of the Elemental Zodiacs](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Fury_of_the_Elemental_Zodiacs) can be used in place of the [Silver Diamond Necklace](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Silver_Diamond_Necklace), but it is not necessary, and is an item to valuable to risk losing. It is important that the player sticks to this loadout, as exceeding the stated damage reduction can lead to Auto Eat not triggering at important points, and using a food inferior to whales decreases the potential recovery from Auto Eat.

The mysterious figure has the following special attacks and passives (alongside the same Affliction that the rest of the dungeon has):

- (_Passive_) Purity: Immune to Player Debuffs (Includes Stuns and Freezes).
- (_Passive_) Melee Proficiency: Immune to all Ranged and Magic Attacks.
- (_50%_) Mark of Death: An unavoidable attack that deals 300 dmg, and applies Mark of Death for 4 turns and can stack up to 3 times (Mark of Death reduces your Damage Reduction by 50%, regardless of how many Stacks are applied).
- (_35%_) Cursed Edge: An avoidable attack that slices at you twice, dealing 600 dmg each. _(0.25 seconds between attacks)_
- (_15%_) Reap and Return: An avoidable attack that attacks you 7 times, plus one extra time per Stack of Mark of Death that is applied to you. Deals 450 dmg each and heals the Enemy for all dmg done. All Mark of Death stacks are removed from Player after attack. _(0.2 seconds between attacks - Mark of Death is removed after first attack)_

This boss phase can only be damaged with melee. The player must be prepared to face much of this dungeon at **half of normal health and damage reduction**, due to Affliction and Mark of Death. This requires the player to heal actively, paying close attention to the enemy's attacks. The enemy is also capable of healing itself, making this a long and slow fight.

The [Protect from Melee](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Protect_from_Melee) nots only to prevent incoming damage, but also prevents the enemy from using Reap and Return to heal. This is a critical part of the approach.

Much as before, the player must be prepared to fight with half of normal hitpoints and damage reduction. To survive the Mark of Death attack, the player needs 66% base damage reduction. This allows the player to use Auto Eat for most of the attacks, and get plenty of hits in.

Cursed Edge hits for more damage than a debuffed player can sustain with auto eat, and it hits twice. To survive the first hit, the player needs at least 397 health. The second hit comes 0.25 seconds later, meaning that the player must heal again immediately after the first hit. Once the player's health is capped at 650, auto eat will do this automatically; before that, this must be done manually.

Reap and Return also hits a potentially deadly blow, so the player must have at least 298 health when it hits. However, the first attack immediately clears Mark of Death, restoring damage reduction to its full amount, reducing the hit to 148. This means that auto eat will handle the damage, and the player can use the time to get more hits in.

This is the longest battle of the boss phases. Healing at the right moments and keeping the boss from gaining too much health back is critical.

**Summary**:

- Use the given melee loadout
- Use Protect from Melee to prevent the enemy from healing
- Idle through Mark of Death attacks
- Heal to at least 397 health before **and during** Cursed Edge attacks - once health is capped at 650, there is no need to heal during
- Heal to at least 298 health before Reap and Return attacks, and idle after the first attack hits

### [Mysterious Figure - Phase 2](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Mysterious_Figure_-_Phase_2)

For this phase of the boss fight, use the following ranged loadout. The choice of weapon is up to the player, so long as it is a single-handed ranged weapon - a crossbown with the rapid attack type is recommended. It is important that the player sticks to this loadout, as exceeding the stated damage reduction can lead to Auto Eat not triggering at important points, and using a food inferior to whales decreases the potential recovery from Auto Eat.

The mysterious figure has the following special attacks and passives (alongside the same Affliction that the rest of the dungeon has):

- (_Passive_) Purity: Immune to Player Debuffs (Includes Stuns and Freezes).
- (_Passive_) Ranged Proficiency: Immune to all Melee and Magic Attacks.
- (_50%_) Mark of Death: An unavoidable attack that deals 300 dmg, and applies Mark of Death for 4 turns and can stack up to 3 times (Mark of Death reduces your Damage Reduction by 50%, regardless of how many Stacks are applied).
- (_35%_) Concealed Danger: An avoidable attack that attacks you 1 time, plus one extra time per Stack of Mark of Death that is applied to you. Deals 450 dmg each. All Mark of Death stacks are removed from Player after attack. _(0.2 seconds between attacks - Mark of Death is removed after first attack)_
- (_15%_) Shadowstep: Enemy surrounds itself with Mist, gaining 20% Attack Speed, 20% Increased Evasion Ratings and +40% Damage Reduction for 2 turns.

To survive the Mark of Death attack, the player needs 66% base damage reduction. This allows the player to use Auto Eat for most of the attacks, and get plenty of hits in. This is the same as for the previous phase.

Concealed Danger hits for more damage than a debuffed player can sustain with auto eat, although only on the first hit. To survive the first hit, the player needs at least 298 health. After that, the Mark of Death is removed, and the player's restored damage reduction reduces the remaining attacks to 148, which auto eat can handle.

While Shadowstep is annoying, the enemy cannot heal itself. This fight should last significantly less time than the previous phase.

**Summary**:

- Use the given ranged loadout
- Use Rigour to increase the hit chance and damage
- Idle through Mark of Death and Shadowstep attacks
- Heal to at least 298 health before Concealed Danger attacks

### [Ahrenia](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Ahrenia)

For this phase of the boss fight, use the following magic loadout. The choice of weapon is up to the player, so long as it is a single-handed magic weapon - an [Imbued Wand](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Fire_Imbued_Wand) is recommended for its attack speed.

| **Slot**  | **Item**                                                                                             | **Reduction** |

Ahrenia has the following special attacks and passives (alongside the same Affliction that the rest of the dungeon has):

- (_Passive_) Purity: Immune to Player Debuffs (Includes Stuns and Freezes).
- (_Passive_) Magic Proficiency: Immune to all Melee and Ranged Attacks.
- (_70%_) Shadow Burst: Fires off 3 large avoidable dark explosions, dealing 800 dmg each. Reduces Player Accuracy Rating by 1% per hit (Can stack, Maximum 40%). _(0.7 seconds between attacks)_
- (_15%_) Into the Mist: Enemy disappears into the Mist, recovering 10% of thier Maximum HP over 10 seconds. Gains +10% Damage Reduction, per successful hit by the Player during this Special Attack (Resets after attack finishes).
- (_15%_) Fallen Light: The Mist breaks away and the sky opens up to a falling ray of Darkness, dealing an unavoidable 400 dmg every 0.2s over 3s (Total 6000 dmg).

Shadow Burst and Fallen Light are survivable with 75% damage reduction, although the gradual accuracy debuff on player accurate eventually add up. Ideally, the player could reach 33334 magic accuracy rating, and cast Ancient Magics with guaranteed hits at 20000 accuracy even when debuffed. However, there is no possible set of equipment that grants both 75% damage reduction and 33334 magic accuracy. Because of the enemy's attack speed and high damage, it is not recommended to rely on manual eating.

The Purity passive ability does not apply to curses and auras. [Surge II](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Surge_II) and [Decay](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Decay) will do a lot to speed up the fight.

The Ancient Magics spell [Gust](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Gust) is a good choice while above 20000 accuracy, as it guarantees a hit and doesn't rack up enemy damage reduction like [Incinerate](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/index.php?title=Incinerate).

This last phase can be safely idled, so long as the player has enough food, runes, potions, and prayer points. A bit of luck and it will eventually be ground down.

**Summary**:

- Use the given magic loadout
- Maintain minimum 75% damage reduction
- Gradually grind down the enemy health
